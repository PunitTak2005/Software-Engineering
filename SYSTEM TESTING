System testing is a level of software testing where a complete, integrated system is tested to ensure it meets the specified requirements and works as expected in a real-world environment. It involves:

1. Testing the entire system, including all components and integrations
2. Verifying that the system works as expected in different scenarios and environments
3. Checking for defects, errors, and inconsistencies
4. Ensuring that the system meets the specified requirements and standards

Types of system testing:

1. Functional testing: testing the system's functionality and features
2. Performance testing: testing the system's performance, scalability, and reliability
3. Security testing: testing the system's security and vulnerability to attacks
4. Usability testing: testing the system's user experience and interface
5. Compatibility testing: testing the system's compatibility with different environments and platforms

System testing techniques:

1. Black box testing: testing without knowledge of internal implementation
2. White box testing: testing with knowledge of internal implementation
3. Gray box testing: testing with partial knowledge of internal implementation
4. Equivalence partitioning: dividing inputs into equivalent partitions
5. Boundary value analysis: testing at input boundaries

Benefits of system testing:

1. Ensures the system works as expected in a real-world environment
2. Detects defects and errors that may have been missed earlier
3. Provides confidence in the system's quality and reliability
4. Helps identify and fix integration issues
5. Reduces the risk of system failure and downtime

System testing tools:

1. Selenium
2. Appium
3. TestComplete
4. Ranorex
5. IBM Rational Test Workbench

By performing thorough system testing, you can ensure that your software application works as expected, meets the specified requirements, and provides a good user experience.
