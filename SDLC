SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle, which is a process used to plan, design, develop, test, and deliver software applications. The SDLC process aims to produce high-quality software that meets user requirements and is delivered on time and within budget.

The SDLC process typically includes the following phases:

1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.
2. Requirements Gathering: Collect and document user requirements.
3. Analysis: Study and analyze the requirements to identify solutions.
4. Design: Create a detailed design of the software architecture.
5. Implementation (Coding): Write the code for the software.
6. Testing: Verify that the software meets the requirements.
7. Deployment: Deliver the software to the end-users.
8. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates.

Some popular SDLC models include:

1. Waterfall: A linear approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next.
2. Agile: An iterative approach, where phases are repeated in cycles (sprints).
3. V-Model: A combination of waterfall and agile approaches.
4. Iterative: A cyclic approach, where phases are repeated until the software is complete.
5. Spiral: A risk-driven approach, where phases are repeated until the software is complete.

Each SDLC model has its strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of model depends on the project requirements, team size, and complexity.
