A time box is a fixed, maximum unit of time allocated for an activity or task. It's a key concept in Agile project management and Scrum framework. Here's how it works:

1. Set a fixed time duration (e.g., 2 weeks, 1 month)
2. Define the tasks to be completed within that time frame
3. Work on the tasks without interruptions or scope changes
4. Stop work when the time box ends, even if tasks are incomplete
5. Review progress, adjust plans, and start a new time box

Time boxing benefits:

1. Improved focus: Concentrate on tasks without interruptions
2. Increased productivity: Work efficiently within a fixed time frame
3. Enhanced prioritization: Prioritize tasks based on time constraints
4. Better estimation: Estimate task duration more accurately
5. Reduced scope creep: Avoid adding new tasks during the time box
6. Regular breaks: Take breaks between time boxes to recharge
7. Continuous improvement: Review and adjust plans after each time box

Common time boxing techniques:

1. Sprints (Scrum): 2-4 week time boxes for development work
2. Iterations (Agile): Fixed time frames for development work
3. Kanban cycles: Time boxes for continuous flow of work
4. Pomodoro Technique: 25-minute time boxes for focused work

By using time boxing, teams can work efficiently, stay focused, and deliver high-quality results within a predictable timeframe.
