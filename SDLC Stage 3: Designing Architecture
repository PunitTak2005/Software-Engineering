SDLC Stage 3: Designing Architecture

The design stage is the third phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves creating a detailed design of the software's architecture, components, and user interface.

Objectives of this stage:

1. Create a detailed design of the software's architecture
2. Define the software's components and their interactions
3. Design the user interface and user experience
4. Develop a detailed design document
5. Create prototypes or mockups

Key activities in the design stage:

1. Architectural design
2. Component design
3. Interface design
4. User experience (UX) design
5. User interface (UI) design
6. Prototyping and mockups
7. Design reviews and feedback

Deliverables from the design stage:

1. Design document
2. Architectural diagrams
3. Component diagrams
4. Interface designs
5. User experience (UX) designs
6. User interface (UI) designs
7. Prototypes or mockups

The output of this stage provides a clear and detailed blueprint for the software's development, ensuring that the final product meets the requirements and expectations.

Some popular design techniques include:

1. Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern
2. Microservices architecture
3. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
4. User-centered design (UCD)
5. Agile design

Design principles:

1. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
2. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
3. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
4. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
5. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
6. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

By following these principles and techniques, you can create a robust, scalable, and maintainable software architecture that meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.
