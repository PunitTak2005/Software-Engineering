The Waterfall model is a linear Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model that consists of the following phases:

Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

- Define project scope and goals
- Identify and document functional and non-functional requirements
- Create a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document

Phase 2: Analysis

- Review and refine the SRS document
- Create a detailed analysis of the requirements
- Identify any potential risks or issues

Phase 3: Design

- Create a detailed design of the system architecture
- Develop a detailed design specification
- Create prototypes or mockups (if necessary)

Phase 4: Implementation (Coding)

- Write the code for the software
- Develop a working version of the software
- Conduct unit testing and integration testing

Phase 5: Testing

- Conduct thorough testing of the software
- Identify and fix any defects or bugs
- Conduct system testing, acceptance testing, and regression testing

Phase 6: Deployment

- Deploy the software to the production environment
- Configure the software for deployment
- Conduct post-deployment testing

Phase 7: Maintenance

- Provide ongoing support and maintenance for the software
- Fix any defects or issues that arise
- Make updates and enhancements to the software as needed

Note that the Waterfall model is a linear approach, meaning that each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. This can make it difficult to make changes to previous phases once they are complete.
