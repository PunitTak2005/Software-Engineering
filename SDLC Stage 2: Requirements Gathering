SDLC Stage 2: Requirements Gathering

The requirements gathering stage is the second phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It involves collecting and documenting the requirements of the stakeholders to ensure that the software meets their needs.

Objectives of this stage:

1. Identify and document functional and non-functional requirements
2. Gather business requirements from stakeholders
3. Define project scope and boundaries
4. Develop a clear understanding of the software's purpose and goals

Key activities in the requirements gathering stage:

1. Stakeholder interviews
2. Surveys and questionnaires
3. Focus groups and workshops
4. Observation and documentation
5. Requirements elicitation
6. Requirements analysis and modeling
7. Requirements specification and documentation

Deliverables from the requirements gathering stage:

1. Business Requirements Document (BRD)
2. Functional Requirements Document (FRD)
3. Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFRD)
4. Use cases and user stories
5. Requirements traceability matrix

The output of this stage provides a clear understanding of the software's requirements, which serves as a foundation for the next stages of the SDLC, including design, implementation, and testing.

Some popular requirements gathering techniques include:

1. Agile User Stories
2. Use Cases
3. Business Process Modeling (BPM)
4. Requirements Workshops
5. Interviews and Surveys

By thoroughly gathering and documenting requirements, you can ensure that the software meets the needs of its users and stakeholders.
