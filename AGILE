Agile refers to the ability to be flexible, adaptable, and responsive to change. In the context of software development, Agile is a methodology that emphasizes:

1. Flexibility: Embracing change and adapting to new requirements.
2. Speed: Delivering working software in short cycles (sprints).
3. Collaboration: Teamwork and communication among stakeholders.
4. Customer satisfaction: Prioritizing customer needs and feedback.
5. Continuous improvement: Regularly reflecting and improving processes.

The Agile Manifesto (2001) values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4. Responding to change over following a plan.

In essence, Agile is about being:

- Adaptable
- Responsive
- Flexible
- Collaborative
- Customer-focused
- Continuously improving

Agile is not just a methodology, but a mindset and a set of principles that can be applied to various fields beyond software development, such as business, project management, and personal development.
