The Waterfall model is a linear, sequential approach to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It follows a phase-by-phase progression, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one.

Phases of the Waterfall model:

1. Requirements Gathering: Collecting and documenting user requirements.
2. Analysis: Breaking down requirements into smaller, manageable pieces.
3. Design: Creating a detailed design of the system.
4. Implementation (Coding): Writing the code for the system.
5. Testing: Verifying that the system meets requirements and works as expected.
6. Deployment: Releasing the system to production.
7. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support and updates.

Characteristics of the Waterfall model:

1. Linear progression
2. Phases are completed sequentially
3. No overlap between phases
4. Each phase has a clear start and end point
5. Emphasis on documentation and planning
6. Change management is challenging

Advantages:

1. Easy to manage and understand
2. Clear milestones and deadlines
3. Emphasis on planning and documentation
4. Suitable for small, well-defined projects

Disadvantages:

1. Inflexible to change
2. High risk of project failure if requirements change
3. Testing occurs late in the cycle
4. Can lead to a "big bang" release, which can be risky

When to use the Waterfall model:

1. Small, well-defined projects
2. Projects with clear, fixed requirements
3. Projects with a low risk of change
4. Projects where documentation and planning are crucial

Remember, the Waterfall model is a traditional approach, and modern software development often uses more flexible and iterative approaches like Agile.
