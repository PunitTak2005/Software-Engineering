The functions of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) include:

1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, timelines, budget, and resources.

2. Requirements Gathering: Collect and document functional and non-functional requirements.

3. Analysis: Review and refine requirements, identify potential risks and issues.

4. Design: Create a detailed design of the system architecture and components.

5. Implementation (Coding): Write the code for the software.

6. Testing: Verify that the software meets requirements and works as expected.

7. Deployment: Deliver the software to the production environment.

8. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, fix defects, and make updates.

9. Configuration Management: Manage changes to the software and its components.

10. Quality Assurance: Ensure that the software meets the required standards.

11. Risk Management: Identify and mitigate potential risks throughout the project.

12. Communication: Facilitate communication among stakeholders, team members, and customers.

These functions ensure that software is developed in a structured, controlled, and repeatable manner, resulting in high-quality software that meets customer needs.
