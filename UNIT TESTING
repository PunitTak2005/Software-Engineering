Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual units of code, typically functions or methods, are tested in isolation to ensure they work as expected. It involves:

1. Writing test cases for individual units of code
2. Isolating dependencies using mock objects or stubs
3. Executing tests to verify expected behavior
4. Asserting expected results or exceptions

Benefits of unit testing:

1. Early defect detection and prevention
2. Improved code quality and reliability
3. Faster development and debugging
4. Reduced integration testing complexity
5. Better code design and structure

Best practices:

1. Keep tests independent and self-contained
2. Use descriptive test names and assertions
3. Test for both happy paths and edge cases
4. Use mock objects or stubs to isolate dependencies
5. Run tests frequently and integrate with CI/CD pipelines

Common unit testing frameworks:

1. JUnit (Java)
2. NUnit (.NET)
3. PyUnit (Python)
4. Test::Unit (Ruby)
5. Jest (JavaScript)

Unit testing techniques:

1. Black box testing: testing without knowledge of internal implementation
2. White box testing: testing with knowledge of internal implementation
3. Gray box testing: testing with partial knowledge of internal implementation
4. Equivalence partitioning: dividing inputs into equivalent partitions
5. Boundary value analysis: testing at input boundaries

By writing effective unit tests, you can ensure your code is reliable, stable, and works as expected, which is crucial for building high-quality software applications.
