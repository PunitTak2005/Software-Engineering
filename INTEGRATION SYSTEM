Integration testing is a software testing technique where individual units of code are combined and tested as a group to ensure they work together seamlessly. It involves:

1. Integrating two or more units of code
2. Testing the interactions and interfaces between them
3. Verifying that data flows correctly between units
4. Ensuring that errors are handled properly

Types of integration testing:

1. Big Bang approach: integrating all units at once
2. Incremental approach: integrating units one by one
3. Top-down approach: integrating from top-level modules down
4. Bottom-up approach: integrating from low-level modules up

Benefits of integration testing:

1. Ensures units work together correctly
2. Detects interface defects and errors
3. Verifies data flow and integrity
4. Reduces system-level testing complexity
5. Improves overall system quality and reliability

Integration testing techniques:

1. Interface testing: testing interfaces between units
2. Data flow testing: testing data flow between units
3. Error handling testing: testing error handling mechanisms
4. Thread testing: testing concurrent execution
5. System testing: testing the entire system

Common integration testing tools:

1. Selenium (web applications)
2. Appium (mobile applications)
3. TestComplete (GUI testing)
4. Postman (API testing)
5. JMeter (performance testing)

By performing integration testing, you can ensure that individual units of code work together seamlessly, which is crucial for building high-quality software applications.
